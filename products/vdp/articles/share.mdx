title: 'Sharing and Embedding Submission Forms'
description: "You can embed the your VDP report submission form onto your website. This enables hackers to submit reports without having to create an account on SnapSec Suite. This also provides hackers with an easy way to submit security vulnerabilities without having to search for the VDP or security policy. With embedded submissions, anyone can submit a report to the program.
Alternatively you can directly send the VDP policy to hackers via email or share the policy on social media"
