description: "User Management in our system empowers administrators with comprehensive control over user access and roles. Administrators have the authority to invite new users as well as remove users from organzation. To enhance security and tailor access permissions, administrators can assign specific roles to users based on their responsibilities and requirements. This role-based access control ensures that individuals have appropriate privileges, maintaining a secure and organized user environment. With these user management features, administrators can effortlessly oversee the system's user landscape, ensuring smooth operations, and enforcing security best practices."
