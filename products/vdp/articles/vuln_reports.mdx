## CVSS


CVSS provides a numerical score that reflects the impact of a vulnerability, allowing organizations to prioritize and address security issues based on their criticality. The score is determined by evaluating various factors like exploitability of the vulnerability, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as other relevant metrics. CVSS scores are presented on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe vulnerabilities. <br/>



<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="CVSS Score">
    The CVSS score, or Common Vulnerability Scoring System score, is a numerical assessment assigned to security vulnerabilities, quantifying their severity and potential impact. Ranging from 0 to 10, a higher CVSS score indicates a more critical vulnerability, aiding in prioritizing remediation efforts based on the assessed risk. This standardized metric considers factors such as exploitability, impact, and complexity to provide an objective measure of vulnerability severity.
    <img height="200" className="glass rounded-xl" src="/images/csm/32.png"/>



  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="CVSS Rating">
    The CVSS String serves as a textual representation of the CVSS score and associated metrics. It encapsulates detailed information about the characteristics influencing the vulnerability's overall score, offering a quick reference for security professionals. This string is commonly used for concise communication, summarizing key attributes of a vulnerability's severity in a format that facilitates rapid comprehension and decision-making.
