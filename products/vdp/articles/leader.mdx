title: 'Leader Board'
description: "LeaderBoard is similar to Hall of Fame. It is a ranking system that displays the names and email addresses of researchers, along with their reputation points, in order of their performance. The top three researchers with the highest points are highlighted at the top. Following these top performers, the rest of the participants are listed in descending order based on their points. It provides a clear and transparent way to see who is leading in contributions and achievements, motivating participants by showcasing and rewarding the best performers, encouraging continuous improvement and engagement as researchers to increase their rankings by earning more points."
