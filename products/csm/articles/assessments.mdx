## Assessment:

Assessment refers to the process of evaluating and analyzing the security posture of a system, network, application, or organization. Assessments are conducted to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats that could be exploited by malicious actors. The goal is to proactively discover and address security issues before they can be exploited. <br/>
The Assessments feature in our product provides a centralized platform to plan, execute, and monitor these assessments. It allows users to track the status of assessments, view analytics, and manage the assessment lifecycle efficiently.

## Assessment Schedule

Scheduling assessments involves the proactive planning and setting of specific dates for conducting security assessments within an organization. By defining the date of assessment in advance, organizations can ensure preparedness, coordinate with relevant stakeholders, and align the assessment activities with broader security objectives. 

## Assessment type

Security assessments come in various types, each serving a specific purpose in evaluating and enhancing the security of systems, networks, or applications.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Black Box">
    Black Box Testing, also referred to as functional or behavioral testing, focuses solely on the external behavior of a system. Testers do not have access to the internal code, structure, or implementation details. This approach simulates the perspective of an external user or attacker, testing the system's functionalities without prior knowledge of its internal workings. Black Box Testing is effective for assessing user experience, functionality, and overall system behavior.


  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="White Box">
    White Box Testing, also known as clear, glass-box, or structural testing, involves examining the internal workings, code, and structure of a system or application. Testers have full knowledge of the internal architecture and logic. This approach aims to ensure that all code paths are tested thoroughly, addressing aspects such as decision branches, loops, and data flow. White Box Testing is often performed by developers or specialized testing teams familiar with the system's internal design.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Grey Box">
    Grey Box Testing combines elements of both White Box and Black Box Testing. Testers have partial knowledge of the internal workings, such as high-level design or limited access to the source code. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment, considering both internal structures and external behaviors. Grey Box Testing is particularly useful for finding vulnerabilities and assessing the system from a semi-informed perspective, striking a balance between thoroughness and realism.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Duration
Test duration refers to the specific time period allocated for conducting a security assessment. It represents the number of days during which security professionals actively evaluate and analyze the target system, network, or application. The duration is a crucial factor that impacts the thoroughness of the assessment, allowing for a comprehensive examination of potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses. The specified number of days per assessment is determined based on the complexity of the target environment, the scope of testing, and the objectives of the assessment. A well-defined test duration ensures that security professionals have adequate time to perform in-depth analysis, simulate real-world attack scenarios, and provide actionable insights to enhance the overall security posture.

</Steps>


## Scope
Assessment scope defines the boundaries, objectives, and specific parameters of a security assessment. It outlines what is included and excluded from the evaluation, detailing the systems, networks, applications, or processes that will be subject to testing. The scope also clarifies the goals and objectives of the assessment, specifying the testing methodologies, tools, and techniques that will be employed. A well-defined assessment scope is crucial for providing clarity to the security team, ensuring that all relevant assets are covered, and establishing clear expectations with stakeholders. It helps prevent misunderstandings and ensures that the assessment aligns with the organization's security objectives and compliance requirements.

## Assessment Analytics
Assessment report provides a comprehensive overview of the security assessment findings for a system, network, or application. It includes key details such as the total number of identified vulnerabilities, their respective status (e.g., open, in progress, resolved), severity levels, and a summary of each vulnerability. The report typically outlines the impact of the vulnerabilities, the steps to reproduce them, and their associated risk levels. Additionally, it may offer insights into the overall security posture, including any trends or patterns observed during the assessment. The goal of the assessment report is to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the security vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and actionable recommendations for remediation, contributing to informed decision-making and effective risk mitigation.
