## Assessment:

Assessment refers to the process of evaluating and analyzing the security posture of a system, network, application, or organization. Assessments are conducted to identify vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and potential threats that could be exploited by malicious actors. The goal is to proactively discover and address security issues before they can be exploited. <br/>
The Assessments feature in our product provides a centralized platform to plan, execute, and monitor these assessments. It allows users to track the status of assessments, view analytics, and manage the assessment lifecycle efficiently.

## Assessment type

Security assessments come in various types, each serving a specific purpose in evaluating and enhancing the security of systems, networks, or applications.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Black Box">
    Black Box Testing, also referred to as functional or behavioral testing, focuses solely on the external behavior of a system. Testers do not have access to the internal code, structure, or implementation details. This approach simulates the perspective of an external user or attacker, testing the system's functionalities without prior knowledge of its internal workings. Black Box Testing is effective for assessing user experience, functionality, and overall system behavior.


  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="White Box">
    White Box Testing, also known as clear, glass-box, or structural testing, involves examining the internal workings, code, and structure of a system or application. Testers have full knowledge of the internal architecture and logic. This approach aims to ensure that all code paths are tested thoroughly, addressing aspects such as decision branches, loops, and data flow. White Box Testing is often performed by developers or specialized testing teams familiar with the system's internal design.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Grey Box">
    Grey Box Testing combines elements of both White Box and Black Box Testing. Testers have partial knowledge of the internal workings, such as high-level design or limited access to the source code. This approach allows for a more comprehensive assessment, considering both internal structures and external behaviors. Grey Box Testing is particularly useful for finding vulnerabilities and assessing the system from a semi-informed perspective, striking a balance between thoroughness and realism.
