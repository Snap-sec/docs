## Two-Factor Authentication
<p> 
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a security mechanism that adds an extra layer of protection to user accounts by requiring the presentation of two different authentication factors during the login process.<br/>
Once a user enables 2FA, in addition to entering their regular password, they will receive a one-time verification code via __email__. This enhances security by ensuring that even if the password is compromised, unauthorized access is prevented without the secondary authentication factor. 
</p>
<Info> Currently CSM only supports verification code via email </Info>
