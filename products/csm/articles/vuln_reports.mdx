## Vulnerability Report Overview

The Vulnerability Report page provides a comprehensive view of an individual security finding, accessible by clicking on any vulnerability from the main vulnerabilities list. Each report combines detailed technical information with collaboration tools and management features to facilitate the entire remediation lifecycle.

## Main Components

The Vulnerability Report Page consists of several key components that work together to provide comprehensive vulnerability management:

| Component                   | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vulnerability Title**     | Displays the specific title or name of the vulnerability being viewed (e.g., "Test").    |
| **Report Content**          | Contains technical details including summary, steps to reproduce, and impact assessment. |
| **Comment & Blocker Panel** | A collaborative space to add comments and manage blockers that might impede remediation. |
| **Report Details Panel**    | Shows vulnerability severity, ownership, status, and technical details.                  |
| **Recent Activity**         | Chronological log of actions and updates related to the vulnerability.                   |

## Report Content

The main body of the vulnerability report contains several structured sections:

- **Summary**: A brief overview of the vulnerability, providing key context
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed instructions for verifying the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Analysis of potential consequences if the vulnerability is exploited
