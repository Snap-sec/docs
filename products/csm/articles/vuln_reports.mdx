## Vulnerability POC:

This is the main component of vulnerability report. This gives organizations the detailed description of the vulnerability and how to verfiy it. This section includes:
1. **Title:** This provides a brief and meaningful descriptor of security issue being documented.
2. **Summary:** This provides a brief yet informative snapshot of the key details related to a specific vulnerability. This allows users to quickly understand the nature of the security issue without delving into the full report.
3. **Steps to reproduce:** This serves as a guide for others to simulate and understand the circumstances under which the vulnerability occurs. By following the provided steps, the individuals responsible for addressing the issue can confirm its existence, investigate its root cause, and subsequently develop and implement an effective solution or mitigation strategy.
4. **Impact:** This shows the potential consequences and severity of a security vulnerability or threat.  The impact is a crucial factor in prioritizing and addressing vulnerabilities, as it helps security professionals and organizations focus their resources on mitigating the most critical and damaging security risks.

<Tip> To __Edit__ any of the above section. Click on __"Edit icon"__ next to the specific section </Tip>

## Status:

This shows the current status of vulnerability.It indicates where the vulnerability stands in terms of the overall process of identification, assessment, and remediation.
Following are the status available  for the reports:
- In-progress
- In-Review
- UnResolved
- Resolved
- False Positive
- Not Appllicable
- Re-Test

> __Changing the status:__ <br/>i. Hover over to the status.<br/> ii. An edit icon will appear. <br/>iii. Click on the edit icon. From dropdown select the appropriate status you want to change to.


## CVSS

CVSS provides a numerical score that reflects the impact of a vulnerability, allowing organizations to prioritize and address security issues based on their criticality. The score is determined by evaluating various factors like exploitability of the vulnerability, the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as other relevant metrics. CVSS scores are presented on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe vulnerabilities. <br/>

CSM provides **CVSS score** as well as **CVSS vector string.** <br/>
**CVSS score:** indicates the numerical impact score<br/>
**CVSS vector string:** is compressed textual representation of the values used to derive the score

> __Editing the CVSS Score:__ To edit the CVSS score hover over to the CVSS vector string and click on edit.

<Tip>Currently CVSS 3.0 is in place.</Tip>

## Report Timeline

This shows the chronological sequence of events and actions related to the lifecycle of a security vulnerability. Highlighting key events such as identification, status changes, CVSS updates, and any other report modifications. It also tracks user actions, including changes, comments and provides the exact date and time of changes. The timeline provides a clear and structured overview of the key milestones and activities associated with addressing a security vulnerability.

## Attachments

This shows the list of attachments that are related to vulnerability and are embedded in the POC. This helps in better understanding the vulnerability by allowing users to include relevant supplementary materials that provide more context or evidence related to the identified vulnerability.
The attachments include screenshots, Video file, log files, configuration files etc etc.

CSM allows users to: <br/>
__i. Upload new attachments__(any-time post submittion of report): Click on Cloud Icon next to attachment section. <br/>
__ii. Delete:__ Click on delete Icon next to specific attachment you want to delete. <br/>
__iii. Download:__ Click on "Download icon" next to specific attachment you want to download. 



## Comments

Another important feature of vulnerability report page is comments feature. This serves as a collaborative space where users can engage in discussions, share observations, propose solutions, or ask questions about the vulnerability. This feature enhances communication and teamwork within the security team, facilitating a transparent exchange of information.
