title: 'Vulnerability Management- Report Submission'
description: 'Assessment Vulnerability Reporting in SnapSec CSM offers a streamlined and collaborative approach to managing vulnerabilities. Each assessment receives a unique, public URL, enabling security teams, regardless of their affiliation or service provider, to submit vulnerability reports. This public accessibility ensures that not only internal teams but also external entities such as third-party pentest services or independent security researchers can contribute to the assessment. This feature enhances transparency and allows organizations to centralize their vulnerability management within SnapSec CSM, promoting a cohesive and efficient response to security issues. The open nature of the URL fosters collaboration, enabling a diverse range of contributors to actively participate in strengthening the overall security posture of the organization.
