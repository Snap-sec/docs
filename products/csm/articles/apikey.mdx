title: 'Vulnerability Management - Manage API KEY '
description: "An API token is a unique and securely generated authentication key that grants access to interact with SnapSec CSM (Cyber Security Management) via API requests. This token serves as a secure credential, allowing external applications or services to manage and interact with the CSM platform programmatically. By including this token in API requests, users can authenticate and authorize actions such as retrieving data, updating configurations, or performing other operations within the SnapSec CSM environment. API tokens provide a convenient and controlled way to enable external systems or scripts to communicate with the CSM platform, ensuring secure and authorized access while facilitating automation and integration with other tools or services."
