{/* ### Top Navigation Bar (Upper Right Corner)
Icons include functionalities such as search, notifications, help/support, user profile management, and a global application menu. These allow users to quickly navigate, find information, and manage their account settings.

### Main Navigation Bar (Left Side)
Provides access to different modules within the SnapSec 360 platform, such as Dashboard (current view), Reports, Assets, Vulnerabilities, Scans, Remediation, Settings, Users, and Integrations. This allows users to navigate to specific areas for detailed management and analysis. */}

### Vulnerability States (Top Center)
These cards provide a high-level summary of the current vulnerability status:

<div className="flex flex-row items-start justify-between gap-2 flex-wrap">
  <div className="text-left max-w-md space-y-2">
    <p><strong>In Review:</strong> The number of vulnerabilities currently being analyzed or investigated.</p>
    <p><strong>Resolved:</strong> The number of vulnerabilities that have been successfully fixed.</p>
    <p><strong>In Progress:</strong> The number of remediation efforts that are currently underway.</p>
    <p><strong>Unresolved:</strong> The number of identified vulnerabilities that have not yet been addressed.</p>
    <p><strong>False Positive:</strong> The number of identified issues that have been determined to not be actual vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Retest:</strong> The number of vulnerabilities that require re-evaluation to confirm successful remediation.</p>
  </div>

  <div className="flex-shrink-0">

  </div>
</div>


### Severity Distribution (Left Panel - Below Vulnerability States)
<div className="flex flex-row items-start justify-between gap-2 flex-wrap">
  <div className="text-left max-w-md space-y-2">
    Illustrates the breakdown of identified vulnerabilities based on their severity level. Displays the total number of vulnerabilities and a visual representation showing the count of vulnerabilities classified as Critical, High, Medium, and Low. This helps understand the overall risk exposure.
    <ul className="">
      <li><strong>Critical</strong> (Red): Vulnerabilities requiring immediate attention that could lead to system compromise with minimal effort.</li>
      <li><strong>High</strong> (Orange): Serious vulnerabilities that should be addressed in short-term remediation planning.</li>
      <li><strong>Medium</strong> (Yellow): Moderate risk issues that should be included in regular remediation cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>Low</strong> (Green): Minor security concerns that pose minimal risk but should still be tracked.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

</div>
### Vulnerabilities Trend
Shows the evolution of the number of detected and resolved vulnerabilities over a specific period. A line graph typically plots the number of 'Detected' vulnerabilities and 'Remediated' vulnerabilities over time, allowing users to track the effectiveness of their vulnerability management program.

<img className="glass rounded-xl hidden dark:block " src="/images/csm/graph_dark.png" alt="Vulnerabilities Trend" />

### Top Performing Members (Left Panel - Below Severity Distribution)
Highlights users or teams who have made significant contributions to vulnerability remediation efforts. Lists individuals (e.g., Imramdemo Imramdemo, Naik Mubashir) and indicates the number of issues they have resolved. This can help identify and acknowledge effective security contributors.

<img className="glass rounded-xl hidden dark:block" width={'200px'} src="/images/csm/top_members_dark.png" alt="Top Performing Members" />

### Top Performing Assessments
Provides an overview of recent or significant vulnerability assessments. Presents a table with information on different assessments (e.g., Web Application Pentesting, CSPM - Cloud Security, VDP Reports, Mobile Application Pentesting), their remediation status, assigned collaborators, and due dates.

### Top 5 Vulnerabilities

Identify and prioritize critical security threats with the Top 5 Vulnerabilities feature. Lists the most critical or high-priority vulnerabilities that require immediate attention, displaying a table with key information including their title, assigned owner, the assessment they belong to, their current state, severity level, and when they were reported. A search function allows for filtering this list.
