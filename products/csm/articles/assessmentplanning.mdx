## Overview

The Vulnerabilities page provides a detailed and comprehensive list of all identified security weaknesses across your assets. It serves as your primary hub for deep-diving into individual vulnerabilities, assessing their details, tracking their status, and managing remediation efforts. This page allows security teams to efficiently review, filter, and prioritize findings to ensure timely resolution..

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Listing**: View all vulnerabilities across your organization in one place
- **Advanced Filtering**: Quickly narrow down findings based on multiple criteria
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor the remediation progress of each vulnerability
- **Severity Classification**: Prioritize issues based on their impact and exploitability
- **Ownership Assignment**: Delegate responsibility and accountability for resolution

### Vulnerability Status Summary Cards

These cards offer a quick quantitative summary of vulnerabilities based on their current status across the entire list.

<div className="flex flex-row items-start justify-between gap-2 flex-wrap">
  <div className="text-left max-w-md space-y-2">
    <p><strong>In Review (23)</strong>: Number of vulnerabilities currently undergoing analysis or awaiting assignment.</p>
    <p><strong>In Progress (10)</strong>: Number of vulnerabilities for which remediation or mitigation efforts have begun.</p>
    <p><strong>False Positive (0)</strong>: Number of identified issues that have been confirmed as not being genuine vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p><strong>Non Applicable (2)</strong>: Number of vulnerabilities deemed not relevant or applicable to the specific asset or context.</p>
    <p><strong>Resolved (3)</strong>: Number of vulnerabilities that have been successfully remediated and closed.</p>
  </div>

<img className="glass rounded-xl hidden dark:block"  src="/images/csm/filter.png" alt="Search and Filter Bar" />

#### Filter Components

- **Search Box (Q Search...)**: Allows free-text search across vulnerability titles, descriptions, or other relevant fields.
- **Severity Filter**: Filters vulnerabilities by their criticality (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, None).
- **Assessments Filter**: Filters vulnerabilities based on the assessment in which they were identified.
- **Owners Filter**: Filters vulnerabilities by the assigned owner responsible for their remediation.
- **State Filter**: Filters vulnerabilities by their current status (e.g., In Review, In Progress, Resolved, Retest).

<Tip>Use multiple filters simultaneously to create highly specific views for different remediation workflows.</Tip>

### Columns Selector

<img className="glass rounded-xl hidden dark:block" src="/images/csm/columns_selector_dark.png" alt="Columns Selector" width="250" />

This feature allows you to customize which columns are displayed in the vulnerability list table, tailoring the view to your specific needs. Click the "Columns" button on the right side of the filter bar to:

- Show or hide specific data points
- Rearrange column order
- Resize columns for better visibility
- Save custom views for future use

### Vulnerability List Table

This is the core component displaying a detailed list of all identified vulnerabilities. Each row represents a unique vulnerability instance.

<img className="glass hidden dark:block rounded-xl" src="/images/csm/vuln_table_dark.png" alt="Vulnerability Table" />

#### Table Columns

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Title | A concise description of the vulnerability | "HTTP Missing Security Headers", "XSS in Dashboard" |
| Owner | Individual or team assigned to resolve the vulnerability | "John Doe", "Security Team", "No Owner" |
| Assessment Name | Security assessment or scan that identified the vulnerability | "Web Application Pentest", "Cloud Security Assessment" |
| State | Current status of the vulnerability (often color-coded) | "In Review", "In Progress", "Resolved" |
| Severity | Impact level of the vulnerability | "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low" |
| Reported On | When the vulnerability was first detected | "1 week ago", "April 15, 2025" |

#### Table Features

- **Sortable Columns**: Click on any column header to sort vulnerabilities
- **Row Selection**: Select individual or multiple vulnerabilities for batch actions
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large vulnerability sets with ease
- **Rows Per Page**: Select display density (10, 25, 50 vulnerabilities per page)

## Working with Vulnerabilities

### Viewing Vulnerability Details

Click on any vulnerability row to open the **Vulnerability Report Page**, which provides comprehensive information about the selected issue. This dedicated page serves as a central hub for understanding the full context of a vulnerability, tracking its lifecycle, facilitating collaboration, and managing its remediation.

<img className="glass hidden dark:block rounded-xl" src="/images/csm/vuln_detail_dark.png" alt="Vulnerability Detail View" />

#### Vulnerability Report Page Components

- **Technical Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including its cause and potential impact
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear instructions for recreating the vulnerability, aiding in verification and remediation
- **Evidence and Screenshots**: Visual documentation of the vulnerability, demonstrating its existence and severity
- **Remediation Recommendations**: Expert guidance on how to address and resolve the security issue
- **Activity Timeline**: Chronological record of all actions taken related to the vulnerability
- **Comments and Collaboration**: Discussion thread for team communication about the vulnerability
- **Status Management**: Controls to update the vulnerability's current state in the remediation lifecycle

<Tip>
Use the tabbed interface in the Vulnerability Report to navigate between different types of information without losing context of the overall issue.
</Tip>

### Managing Vulnerability Workflow

1. **Assignment**: Assign vulnerabilities to team members responsible for remediation directly from the Vulnerability Report page
2. **Status Updates**: Track progress through status changes (In Review → In Progress → Resolved)
3. **Verification**: Request retesting of resolved vulnerabilities to confirm successful remediation
4. **Documentation**: Add notes, upload additional evidence, or document remediation steps for team knowledge sharing

## Best Practices

- Regularly review "In Review" vulnerabilities to ensure timely assignment
- Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and potential impact
- Set realistic deadlines for remediation based on complexity
- Document remediation steps for knowledge sharing and future reference

<Note>
Remember that vulnerability management is an ongoing process. Regular reviews and updates to this list ensure your organization maintains an accurate view of its security posture.
