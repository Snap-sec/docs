description: "The Assets feature in our system provides a comprehensive overview of an organization's digital infrastructure. Users can conveniently view a detailed list of all company assets, distinguishing between those that have undergone testing and those pending assessment. The page offers crucial insights into each asset's testing history, including when the assessment was conducted. For effective risk management, users can assess the security status of each asset, with details on the number of open and closed vulnerabilities associated with them. Additionally, the feature provides a total organizational risk score, offering a high-level snapshot of the overall security posture. Users can further drill down into individual assets to access specific risk scores for a more granular understanding. The ability to schedule assessments directly from this page enhances workflow efficiency, allowing organizations to proactively manage and improve their security posture across their digital assets."
