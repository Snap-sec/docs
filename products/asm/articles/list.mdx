  <Step title="Click on Apply">
  </Step>


</Steps>



<Tip>Use filters to quickly find and address vulnerabilities based on their severity.</Tip>







## Suppress Vulnerabilities

The Suppress Vulnerabilities feature allows you to hide specific vulnerabilities that are not relevant to your current focus. Suppressed vulnerabilities will remain hidden from the vulnerability list even if found in other scans.



#### Suppressing Vulnerabilities


<Warning>When you suppress a vulnerability with a specific title in any asset, all vulnerabilities with the same title across all assets will be suppressed as well. This helps to ensure consistent management and reduces clutter by hiding identical vulnerabilities in different locations.</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="In Options Coulmn, Click on 3 dots next to any vulnerability">
    <img className="glass rounded-xl" src="/images/asm2/17.png"/>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on Supress">
  </Step>
</Steps>



#### View Suppressed Vulnerabilities

The Show Suppressed Vulnerabilities feature lets you view and manage suppressed vulnerabilities. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on Eye Icon">
    <p>Click on the eye icon in the vulnerability list to view suppressed vulnerabilities.</p>
    <img className="glass rounded-xl" src="/images/asm2/18.png" alt="View Suppressed Vulnerabilities" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="This will show only suppressed vulnerabilities">
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>When you suppress a vulnerability with a specific title in any asset, all vulnerabilities with the same title across all assets will be suppressed as well. This helps to ensure consistent management and reduces clutter by hiding identical vulnerabilities in different locations.</Warning>







#### UnSuppressing Vulnerabilities
<Steps>
  <Step title="Click on Eye Icon">
    <p>Click on the eye icon in the vulnerability list to view suppressed vulnerabilities.</p>
    <img className="glass rounded-xl" src="/images/asm2/18.png" alt="View Suppressed Vulnerabilities" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on 3 Dots">
    <p>Click on the 3 dots on any suppressed vulnerability and select 'Unsuppress'.</p>
    <img className="glass rounded-xl" src="/images/asm2/19.png" alt="Unsuppress Vulnerability" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm">
    <p>Click Confirm to unsuppress the selected vulnerability.</p>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<p>The vulnerability will return to the main vulnerability list.</p>


<Warning>When you unsuppress a single vulnerability, all vulnerabilities with the same title across all assets will be unsuppressed as well. This ensures consistent visibility of vulnerabilities with identical titles.</Warning>








## Search Vulnerabilities

The Search Vulnerabilities feature allows you to search for specific vulnerabilities based on their title. This helps in quickly locating and managing particular vulnerabilities.
