title: 'Vulnerability Management - Blockers '
description: "__Blockers__ in our system function as specialized tasks designed to highlight critical issues or impediments that need immediate attention. Similar to regular tasks, blockers are assigned to specific users within the organization responsible for addressing and resolving them. Each blocker comes with a defined priority level, allowing users to quickly discern the urgency of the issue. Additionally, due dates can be assigned to blockers, ensuring that the responsible parties are aware of the timeline for resolution. This feature aids in efficient task management, streamlining the process of identifying and overcoming obstacles that might impede progress. Blockers play a crucial role in maintaining project momentum by providing a focused and organized approach to addressing high-priority issues within specified timeframes."
